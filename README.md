## Ideasï¼š
0. choose a step that detectives can't reach in the next round (MUST)
1. choose a step that is far away from all detectives (by dividing map and using Dijkstra's to calculate distance)
2. make sure mrX is ready for reveal round (go to a stop with more transportation posibilities)
3. use black card and double move after reveal

## Algorithm
